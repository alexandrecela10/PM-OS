# /name-audit

Input: a repo path, plus names the PM already knows about (client, target employer, fund). Output: `outputs/portfolio/<slug>/name-audit.md`, then edits and a commit once approved.

## Steps

1. **Collect candidates.** Names the PM gives, plus proper nouns found in the README, UI strings, prompts, seed data and test fixtures. Check each: is it a real company? Invented-sounding demo names (e.g. "NovaPay") often are.
2. **Search every place names hide.** Record file and line for each hit:

| Place | How |
|---|---|
| Code, prompts, UI strings | grep, case-insensitive |
| Docs, README, demo scripts | grep |
| Filenames | find by pattern |
| Seed data, SQL, fixtures, tests | grep. Fixtures often use real companies (e.g. Tabby, Rize) |
| Domains and social links | grep for `.io`, `.ai`, `.com`, `linkedin.com/` in demo data |
| PDF, slide and image text | extract text (e.g. `pypdf`) and grep; metadata titles too |
| Repo name, remote, Pages URL | `git remote -v` |
| Videos and screenshots | list them; the PM checks by eye |
| Footers | "Confidential", client logos, copyright lines |

3. **Propose replacements.**
   - Clients, targets and employers become neutral roles ("the investment team").
   - Demo companies become clearly fictional names ("Fintech A").
   - Demo domains use the reserved `.example` TLD.
   - Competitors become categories.
   - Public data sources stay (SEC, EY, Arcadis), because they back numbers.
4. **Wait for approval.** Present the list and edit nothing yet.
5. **Apply.**
   - Run the test suite before and after. Tests must still pass.
   - Rename files with `git mv`.
   - Fix any comment the rename made meaningless.
6. **Re-run the search.** Report what's left and why: PDFs with no source to regenerate, fixtures the PM chose to keep.
7. **Commit only if the PM asks.** Never push without approval.

## Output format

`name-audit.md`: status line, a table (where, current, proposed), names kept and why, repo hygiene found (untracked READMEs, logs, secrets in history).
