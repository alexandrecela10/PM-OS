name: opportunity-analysis
description: A short, go/no-go gate before any PRD gets written, problem statement, current situation with one concrete pain example, proposed solution, hypothesis, and a Hormozi Value Equation gut-check on whether the people it's for would actually want it. Condensed from Marty Cagan's Opportunity Assessment (INSPIRED, 10 questions there, 4 plus a gut-check here). Runs after clarifying questions, before /prd-draft. Use when a PM has an idea and needs to decide whether it's worth a PRD at all, not when the PRD is already approved and in motion.

# /opportunity-analysis: Opportunity Analysis

When the PM types `/opportunity-analysis`, run the gate: clarifying questions → a short opportunity doc → an explicit Go / No-go / Parked call.

**What this is not:** a PRD. It's cheaper and comes first. A PRD costs six sections and often a full review loop, most ideas don't deserve that yet. This decides whether an idea deserves the PRD at all, condensed from Cagan's ten-question Opportunity Assessment (*INSPIRED*) down to four questions plus one value gut-check, because most PMs don't need the full ten to make a call.

**Where this sits:** clarifying questions → **opportunity analysis (this)** → `/prd-draft` → `/prd-review-panel` or `/prd-graph`. `/prd-draft` checks for an approved opportunity analysis before drafting (see that skill's Step 0) and skips re-asking anything already answered here.

---

## Quick Start

```
/opportunity-analysis [rough idea or problem]   → Clarifying questions, then draft
/opportunity-analysis --skip-gate               → PM says this idea is obviously worth a PRD; skip straight to /prd-draft instead
```

---

## Context Routing

Same sources as `/prd-draft`: `context-library/business-info*.md`, `context-library/strategy/`, `context-library/research/`. Also check `outputs/opportunity-analyses/` (or this project's own override path, see Step 3) for an existing draft on this feature before starting fresh; don't duplicate one that already exists.

## Tone & Audience (added 2026-09-07, PM correction)

**Default reader is the decision-maker, not an engineer.** The entire point of an opportunity assessment (Cagan) is to get someone who can say go/no-go to actually say it, usually the founder/exec, not an engineering peer who'll read the PRD later. Write for them by default:

- **No inline citations.** State facts plainly and confidently, this is a business document, not a technical one. Keep a single compact **Sources** line at the very bottom (file paths only, no prose) so facts stay checkable without cluttering the read.
- **Lead with problem, hypothesis, and value.** State what must change before how it might be delivered. Cut anything that only makes sense to someone who's read the codebase; that belongs in the PRD, not here. Keep tools, channels, architecture, data sources, and build-versus-integrate choices out of the opening and Proposed Solution unless one is already decided.
- **Visualize the pain, when there's something to show.** A short before/after table (time, steps, screens, whatever's actually true) beats a paragraph of description. Skip it when the pain isn't actually visual, a positioning or strategy problem has no "screens" to compare, and forcing a table there is worse than skipping it.
- **Visualize the proposed solution, 1-2 screens max, when there's something to show.** Strip engineering framing (no JTBD/CTA labels), just the picture and a one-line caption. If a PRD or prior sketch already exists for this feature, simplify from that instead of drawing fresh.
- **Stay factual.** Exec tone doesn't mean softer claims, it means the same facts, stated more directly, with the paper trail moved to a footnote instead of paraded inline.

**Switch to technical mode**, inline citations return, visuals become optional rather than default, when the actual reader is an engineer assessing feasibility, not a business decision-maker assessing priority. Signal: `--technical`, or the PM says who this is really for.

This is the same "by audience" principle already stated generally in PM-OS's root `CLAUDE.md` (Internal/Exec/Technical/User-facing), wired into this skill's actual default behavior rather than left as a reminder to apply manually each time.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Clarifying questions (adaptive, same rule as `/prd-draft`)

Check what the PM already gave you before asking. Skip anything context-library or the prompt already answers. Ask only the gaps, and only these four:

1. **What problem, precisely**, not a category? (the pain, not the fix)
2. **Who feels it, and how do you know**, an observed pain, or an inferred one? (Be honest here, "I read the code and inferred this" is a real, valid answer, just a weaker one than "a user told me")
3. **What's the current workaround today, and what's actually wrong with it?**
4. **What must change for the user or business**, one sentence? Define the needed capability or outcome, not the implementation.

Confirm the brief back in one paragraph before drafting. Don't skip this, everything downstream depends on it being right.

### Step 2: Draft

Use exactly this structure. Target **under ~300 words** outside the Value Equation table and Recommendation, if it's creeping toward PRD length, that's the tell that this is the wrong output for this step; stop and cut.

```markdown
# [Idea name]: Opportunity Analysis

**Date:** [date]
**Owner:** [name]
**Status:** Draft / Go / No-go / Parked

## Problem Statement

[One or two sentences. The pain, not the feature. No category language, "users want a better experience" is not a problem statement. Plain English, no jargon a founder wouldn't use.]

## Current Situation

[What happens today, in one or two plain sentences, no jargon, no code-level detail.]

**The pain, at a glance** *(include when it's actually visual, time, steps, screens; skip for a positioning/strategy problem with nothing to compare, don't force a table where there's nothing to put in it)*

[A short before/after table. Rows are whatever's actually true for this problem, time to notice, number of places to check, what you actually see today vs. with the fix. Not narrative prose; a table someone can read in five seconds.]

**A concrete case.** [One named instance of the pain, real if you have one, a labelled hypothetical if you don't. Not an abstract persona. This is the most important paragraph in the document: if you can't write a concrete example, the problem probably isn't real yet, and that's worth knowing before a PRD gets written, not after.]

## Proposed Solution

[Start with the what: the capability, behavior, or outcome that must change, and for whom. Do not lead with a page, tool, channel, architecture, data source, or build-versus-integrate choice. The PRD is where the implementation gets specified.]

## Sub-problems

[Numbered. What causes the problem statement, one line each, bold label. Mark each: tackled by this proposal, or not. Untackled ones go under "Not tackled here" below, with what's missing.]

## Hypothesis

One per tackled sub-problem. Each gets its own one-row before → after.

**Sub-problem [N]:**
**If we** [change X],
**then** [observable Y should change],
**because** [causal mechanism Z].

**Not tackled here:** [untackled sub-problems, one line each]

## How It Could Be Delivered (optional; include only when useful for the decision)

[Put pages, tools, channels, architecture, data sources, build-versus-integrate options, and 1-2 simplified visuals here. Keep undecided choices explicitly open. Reuse and simplify an existing sketch when one exists.]

## Value Equation (Hormozi)

> Adapted from Alex Hormozi's Value Equation (*$100M Offers*): Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice). Built for a customer with a choice not to buy, for an internal tool, read "would they actually use it" wherever it says "would they buy it." A gut-check on desirability, not a technical feasibility check.

| Factor | This solution |
|---|---|
| **Dream outcome** | [what does success feel like for them, in their own words, not a feature description] |
| **Perceived likelihood** | [will they believe, before they've used it, that this will actually deliver, high skepticism kills adoption even when the solution is good] |
| **Time delay** | [how long until they feel the benefit, from the moment it ships] |
| **Effort & sacrifice** | [what do they have to do, learn, or give up to get the benefit, a new habit, a new tab to remember, a workflow change] |

**Verdict.** [Strong or weak ratio, and if weak, name the *cheapest lever*: raising belief, cutting delay, or cutting effort is usually cheaper than improving the outcome itself. Don't skip straight to "make the outcome better."]

## Recommendation

**Go / No-go / Parked, one sentence why.** If Go: proceed to `/prd-draft`. If No-go or Parked: name the specific thing that would change the answer, so this isn't a dead end.

## Open Questions

[Only what's genuinely unresolved and blocks the Go/No-go call itself, not a general punch list. If nothing blocks the call, leave this section out.]
```

### Step 3: Save + companion files

Save to `outputs/opportunity-analyses/[feature-name]-opportunity.md`, **unless this project's own `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` overrides the output path**, in which case that wins (check it first; don't default blindly to `outputs/`).

Per the standing rule (added 2026-09-06, `{pm-os}/CLAUDE.md`): every output ships with its success criteria and a decision record. Draft both alongside this doc:
- A short **goals file** (`[feature-name]-opportunity-goals.md`): 3-5 binary criteria, e.g. "the Example paragraph names something concrete, not a category or abstract persona"; "all four Value Equation factors are filled, none left as a placeholder"; "the Recommendation states Go/No-go/Parked explicitly."
- A **state file** (`[feature-name]-opportunity-state.json`): the recommendation made, why, and what would change it, so the next session doesn't re-litigate a call that was already made.

### Step 4: Report the call and handoff

State the Go / No-go / Parked recommendation plainly, not buried in prose. If Go, offer to run `/prd-draft` next, it reads this file automatically (Step 0 of that skill) and won't re-ask what's already answered here; the Value Equation carries forward into the PRD rather than getting re-derived from scratch.

---

## Integration with other skills

**Before this:** the adaptive clarifying-questions rule (check `context-library/` before asking anything).

**After a Go:** `/prd-draft`, reads this file, skips duplicate questions, carries the Value Equation forward.

**Not a replacement for `/impact-sizing`.** This is qualitative (should we even look at this?); `/impact-sizing` is quantitative (funnel math, driver trees) and belongs later, typically at Planning Review, once the opportunity has already cleared this gate. Running impact-sizing before an opportunity analysis is solving the wrong problem first.

**Not a replacement for `/prd-review-panel` or `/prd-graph`.** Those review a PRD that already exists. This decides whether one should exist.

---

## Output Quality Self-Check

Before presenting the draft, first run the root `CLAUDE.md` Voice check: no em dashes anywhere in the document, no unearned superlatives (instant, seamless, powerful), no sales-style reassurance ("with confidence," "no more guessing"). This document is exec-facing by default, which raises the temptation to sell rather than inform. Resist it. Then check:

- [ ] Under ~300 words outside the Value Equation table and Recommendation, if it reads like a PRD, cut it back down
- [ ] No inline citations (unless technical mode), facts stated plainly, with a single Sources line at the bottom so they're still checkable
- [ ] The concrete case names something real (a real incident, or a labelled hypothetical), never an abstract persona
- [ ] The Proposed Solution starts with what must change, not a page, tool, channel, architecture, data source, or build-versus-integrate choice
- [ ] Any unresolved implementation options appear later under "How It Could Be Delivered" or Open Questions, not in the opening or Proposed Solution
- [ ] Every fact is true and checkable via the Sources line, exec tone is not permission to soften or invent a claim
- [ ] The pain visualization is present when the pain is actually visual, and skipped (not forced) when it isn't
- [ ] The solution sketch, if included, is 1-2 screens max with engineering framing (JTBD/CTA) stripped out
- [ ] All four Value Equation factors are filled in, no placeholder text left in
- [ ] The Recommendation is an explicit Go / No-go / Parked, never left implicit or hedged into "it depends"
- [ ] Saved to the project's actual output location (checked for a per-project override first)
- [ ] A companion goals file and state file exist alongside it
